HakOlyHak is a group of people involved in computer/information/application/network security. Whether you're an infosec vet
or new to the field, we'd like to meet you! We're based in the Olympia, WA area. If you have a project or cool thing
you'd like to share, we'd love to hear about it.

We try to meet once a month or so to discuss current information security news and events, conferences, projects,
job opportunities, etc. We also usually demo projects we're working on or cool tools we've discovered.

Shout at us online!
